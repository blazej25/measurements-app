# Features to implement
- [ ] circular pipe feature
  - [x] calculate the cross section area
  - [x] calculate the number of measurement points given the formula in the table
  - [ ] select the method for calculating the measurement point locations
  - [ ] paste the point location diagram drawing (nice to have)
  - [ ] calculate the point locations (make a separate unit-testable module for that)
- [ ] rectangular pipe feature
  - [ ] calculate the cross section area (and display in the app)
  - [ ] calculate the number of measurement points given the formula in the table
  - [ ] understand the elaborate logic for figuring out the measurement point
        grid locations

## Notes
  - focus on the business logic first and make it testable
